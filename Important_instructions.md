                                        WASTEZERO - A MERN STACK PROJECT

how to run ---

            1.open split terminal.
            2.cd frontend and cd backend.
            3.npm install(only for 1st time)-- both terminal.
            4.npm run dev --both terminal.
            5.go to - http://localhost:5173/
            6.that's it.

point to be noted---

        (i) if the site fails to load data from database(due to api load),
        just terminate the backend terminal (ctrl C then Y then enter)
        and restart the backend by npm run dev.

        (ii) try to use the site in light mode as dark mode colour grading is not that good.

        (iii) when you start the backend terminal, in the terminal you can see the admin password
        (in case the system admin forgets the password).

want to login as admin---

        email- admin@wastezero.com
        password- admin@123
